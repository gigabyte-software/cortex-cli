# Commit: Complete Phase 3 & 4 - Orchestration and Custom Commands

## Summary

Major update implementing real-time streaming, orchestrators, and custom command support. Completes Phase 3 (Orchestration) and Phase 4 (Custom Commands).

## Key Features

### 🌊 Real-Time Output Streaming
- Command output now streams as it happens (not batched)
- Added streaming support to all executors
- Better user experience for long-running commands

### 🎭 SetupOrchestrator
- Refactored `cortex up` logic into dedicated orchestrator
- Cleaner architecture and separation of concerns
- UpCommand reduced from 163 to 70 lines

### 🎮 CommandOrchestrator
- New orchestrator for custom commands
- Executes user-defined commands from cortex.yml
- Real-time streaming support

### 🚀 cortex run Command
- Execute custom commands: `cortex run test`
- List available commands: `cortex run --list`
- Beautiful formatted output

## Changes

### New Files (3)
- `src/Orchestrator/SetupOrchestrator.php`
- `src/Orchestrator/CommandOrchestrator.php`
- `src/Command/RunCommand.php`

### Modified Files (6)
- `src/Command/UpCommand.php` - Refactored to use SetupOrchestrator
- `src/Application.php` - Register orchestrators and RunCommand
- `src/Executor/HostCommandExecutor.php` - Added streaming callbacks
- `src/Executor/ContainerCommandExecutor.php` - Added streaming callbacks  
- `src/Docker/ContainerExecutor.php` - Added streaming callbacks
- `tests/fixtures/cortex.yml` - Added example custom commands

### Documentation (4)
- `PHASE3_4_COMPLETE.md` - Implementation details
- `TESTING_PHASE3_4.md` - Testing guide
- `test-complete.sh` - Comprehensive test script
- `README.md` - Updated with new commands

## Usage Examples

### Define Custom Commands

```yaml
commands:
  test:
    command: "php artisan test"
    description: "Run test suite"
  
  migrate:
    command: "php artisan migrate"
    description: "Run database migrations"
```

### Run Custom Commands

```bash
# List available commands
cortex run --list

# Run a command
cortex run test
cortex run migrate
```

## Technical Details

### Real-Time Streaming

Uses Symfony Process callbacks to stream output line-by-line:

```php
$outputCallback = function ($type, $buffer) {
    // Stream stdout/stderr in real-time
    $this->formatter->commandOutput($buffer);
};

$executor->execute($cmd, $outputCallback);
```

### Architecture Improvement

**Before:**
- UpCommand: 163 lines with all logic inline
- No custom command support

**After:**
- UpCommand: 70 lines delegating to SetupOrchestrator
- CommandOrchestrator handles custom commands
- Clean separation of concerns

## Testing

Run comprehensive tests:

```bash
cd /home/rob/projects/cortex-cli
./test-complete.sh
```

Manual testing:

```bash
cd tests/fixtures
../../bin/cortex up          # Test streaming + orchestrator
../../bin/cortex run --list  # Test command listing
../../bin/cortex run hello   # Test custom command
../../bin/cortex status      # Test status
../../bin/cortex down        # Test cleanup
```

## Breaking Changes

None! All existing functionality works exactly as before.

## Benefits

1. **Better UX** - Real-time feedback during command execution
2. **Cleaner Code** - UpCommand is 57% smaller
3. **More Features** - Custom commands unlock unlimited possibilities
4. **Maintainable** - Clear separation between orchestration and presentation

## What's Next

Phase 5: Polish & PHAR
- Progress indicators (spinners)
- PHAR build for easy distribution
- Final polish and documentation
